# FoodBuddy
A self-contained app that can save and browse recipes from the web.
NOTE: you may have to update the launchers, depending if Python3 is run
with 'py' or 'python3' on your system.

# Requirements
- python 3 (add python 3 scripts directory to path if not already there)

- Has been tested on the following operating systems, although it should work 
on any OS that can run PyQt5:
  - Windows 10
  - Mac OS version 10.12, 10.13, 10.14 
  
- PyQt5
  - pip3 install pyqt5

# How to run
After you have the requirements, you can launch the app using run_mac or run_windows
within the launchers/ folder.  Recipes are stored in the data/ folder which is created
the first time FoodBuddy runs.
